<br/><br/>

The source code of each cheat code can be found in the "Source Code" folder.<br />
If you want to edit and compile the source code, see: https://github.com/Mewtality/WiiU-PowerPC-ASM-Library
<br/><br/>
All cheat codes were written and tested on Mario Kart 8 v4.1 (PAL). They should work on all regions regardless.
<br/><br/>
"**codelist.xml**" contains all codes ready to be used in Jgecko U. But before that you need to:
- rename the file to your game's region (European: **AMKP01.xml**; American: **AMKE01.xml**; Japanese: AMKJ01)
- place the file in the "codes" folder of Jgecko U.<br/><br/><br/>
