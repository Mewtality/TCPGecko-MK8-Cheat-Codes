# TCPGecko-MK8-Cheat-Codes
Various cheat codes for Mario Kart 8 (Wii U) written in PowerPC Assembly.
<br/><br/>
To use these cheat codes you need to download:

- Jgecko U: https://github.com/BullyWiiPlaza/JGeckoU
- TCP Gecko: https://github.com/BullyWiiPlaza/tcpgecko
<br/><br/>

## codelist.xml
This contains all codes ready to be used in Jgecko U. But before that you need to:
- Rename the file to your game's region:
	- European: **AMKP01**.xml
	- American: **AMKE01**.xml
	- Japanese: **AMKJ01**.xml

- Place the renamed codelist file in the "codes" folder of Jgecko U. If there is no folder named "codes" where "Jgecko U.jar" is located, create one.

<br/><br/>

All cheat codes were written and tested on Mario Kart 8 v4.1 (PAL). They should work on all regions regardless.
