# TCPGecko-MK8-Cheat-Codes
Various cheat codes for MK8 (Wii U) written in PowerPC Assembly.

To use these cheat codes you must download:

- Jgecko U: https://github.com/BullyWiiPlaza/JGeckoU
- TCP Gecko: https://github.com/BullyWiiPlaza/tcpgecko


All cheat codes in this repository are "Raw Machine Codes". This means you have to enable the feature when adding the code to your code list in Jgecko U:

The source code of each cheat code can be found in the "Source Code" folder. The machine code, which is what you use for enabling the hack, can be found in the "Machine Code" folder.


All cheat codes were written and tested on Mario Kart 8 v4.1 (PAL). They should work on all regions regardless.
